# Hotel-Booking-Demand
This dataset consists of booking data from a city hotel and a resort hotel. It includes many details about the bookings, including room specifications, the length of stay, the time between the booking and the stay, whether the booking was canceled, and how the booking was made. The data was gathered between July 2015 and August 2017.


I'll be exploring the areas of who is creating these reservation, where are guests traveling from, along with exploring the cancellations. 

WIth this exploration we can see how hotels can possibly retain business and how they can approach future promotions.
